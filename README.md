# GoldenDome
Golden Dome AI Defense Simulation — Agentic Multi-Layered Missile Interception Network An AI-first simulation of a next-generation U.S. missile defense architecture inspired by the “Golden Dome” strategic vision — as outlined by President Donald Trump in recent national security briefings.
This project models a multi-agent, real-time missile interception system that combines satellite data, radar feeds, AI-guided countermeasures, and autonomous targeting logic. It uses LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI to simulate an intelligent defense mesh capable of:

Detecting, tracking, and intercepting ICBMs, hypersonics, and drone swarms

Orchestrating agent-based responses using layered logic across ground, sea, air, and space

Replicating autonomous decision loops with human-in-the-loop safety agents

Simulating zero-latency responses using synthetic NORAD-style sensor data

Agent Roles:

🛰️ Orbital Threat Detection Agent: Processes mock satellite & radar feeds

⚔️ Interceptor Assignment Agent: Chooses and deploys appropriate missile response

🧠 Strategic Command Agent: Coordinates simulation-wide intelligence

🧑‍✈️ Human Oversight Crew: Simulated military command override (via CrewAI)

🧪 Built With
LangChain + LangGraph for agent flow and task memory

CrewAI to simulate structured military command and overrides

OpenAI / LLaMA3 / Claude for agent cognition

Python and bash scripting for automation and telemetry

Modular plugin support for future real-world defense integrations
